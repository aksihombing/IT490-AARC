need to ask prof:

- midterm challenges + grace?
grades based on if youre on the right track.
i hope im on the right track.

- what are the last two exercises?
5 - systemd, deployment, and clustering
6 - deliverable checkpoint


- how are exercises being graded?
---> did you do it or not?


- deployment flow

all dev has bundler script
    > bundle.sh uses tarball
    > we connect to deployment vm to ask the version of the bundle name via PHP RMQ script
    > in bundle.sh, we update the tar_name to include number of next version? i.e. 02_tar_name.tar.gz
    > how do we send the tar through scp to get to qa?
---> dispatcher

- how to mark status on a package from the QA level? are we running another shell script to ssh into deploy VM to update the database's status for the bundle? > then if deploy processor finds that the status is updated to passed, it sends it into prod?
---> make cli utility (shell script) to send messages to send fromdev or dploy

- are we keeping a copy of the bundle in the deploy vm? the database should have a filepath to the specific tar that was scp'd then??
---> keep filepath in database 


- rollback ? is this rolling back changes in production in case it fails/breaks? or should rollback just be on QA






-------------------------------

- where do we rollback?  QA and production?
both

- should we be sending a "status success" from QA to automatically push it to production, or just send if it failed
successful install doesnt mean it successfully passed testing!!!!!


- where are we manually sending a status success request?
only dev

- if we are unable to get deployment fully working, what other of the common deliverables are possible?
"everything else"


---------------------------------

- if installation fails in QA, should we be automatically marking the bundle as failed in deployment db?



- are we logging onto QA at all???


- can we marked something that was previously marked as "passed" to "failed"? (i.e. it passed QA but we see that despite the successful install, there are errors)?
